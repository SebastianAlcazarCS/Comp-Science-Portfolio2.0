    <p>I am a very playful person and I tend to joke around a lot. I am very friendly and usually will start a conversation with anyone. </p>
<p>I like a lot of things such as video games and watching twitch streams. I really enjoy eating Hot Pockets! I always was a fan of fast easy food and since I spend a lot of time infront of the computer I am eating a lot of them since I don't really have too much time to make a real meal until later in the afternoon. I got into video games since I was a kid but now that I am older I play them more seriously and really spend time getting better at them. I really enjoy the whole concept of them especially some of the cool story lines.</p>

    <h1>My Biggest Hobby</h1>
    <p>My biggest hobby is video games. I really enjoy playing them in all of my spare time. I really try hard to finish all of my work so that I can play the most time possible. I was always really into them as a child but now that I am older I have a big oppurtunity to really play them as something I really enjoy</p>
